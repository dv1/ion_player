externals:
==========

jsoncpp 0.5.0                - Public Domain (according to http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/)
dumb 0.9.3                   - DUMB license (similar to zlib)
adplug 2.2.1                 - LGPL v2.1
libbinio 1.4                 - LGPL v2.1
mpg123 1.12.3                - LGPL v2.1
Game Music Emulator 0.5.2    - LGPL v2.1
uade 2.13                    - GPL v2

With the exception of jsoncpp, these externals are all used for respective plugins, and ultimately are NOT essential parts of ion.


main code:
==========

This is a TODO. the directory structure needs to be cleaned up a bit to differ between libraries, plugins, and programs. Programs would get GPLed,
libraries would use MIT/zlib/libpng/BSD/Boost licensing, most plugins would use the same as libraries (with the exception of the uade plugin, which
is GPLed).
